My passion for Astronomy started when I heard Twinkle, twinkle little star  rhymes for the first time. It lit my curiosity about various things such as where I live, why are the stars and moon hang in the sky only at night, and the sun in the morning. Then, I started to quench my thirst through books, videos, and TV channels like National Geographic, Discovery channel, etc. One fine day, I came across interesting news that Kalpana Chawla was the first Indian woman to go to space. I was super inspired that I wanted to share the same passion for astronomy and would like to follow her footpaths on becoming an astronaut. After having such thoughts, I started to pick up interest in cosmology, constellations, mythologies, and folklore associated with celestial bodies, other habitable planets, and missions related to intergalactic voyages, etc. To keep following my passion and meet people who share similar interests in space, I joined our Astro club of CEG. It allowed me to make contributions and learn many new things. ","Image_name":"31.jpg","Designation":"Social media and Marketing Executive Head"}
